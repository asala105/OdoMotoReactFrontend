## OdoMoto (the admin and HR side)

The demand on fleet management systems is increasing with the growing number of businesses 
converting to online and increased demand for advanced delivery services. Such systems allow the 
users to track the performance of commercial vehicles. It can take the shape of vehicle tracking, 
diagnostics, maintenance, driver performance monitoring, and fuel usage monitoring, among other 
things. Vehicle diagnostics and maintenance, driver performance, fuel consumption, and movement 
plans will be the emphasis of this project.

These duties were formerly performed manually, requiring time-consuming record-keeping, and 
filing, as well as the possibility of human error. Using a fleet management system (like OdoMoto), you can 
complete all these activities faster, easier, and more precisely than ever before. This website/app is tailored to perform functions like:

- fuel and odometer records,
- vehicles data and inspection schedule,
- field service management(movement plans and fleet requests),
- and driver management(Attendance and leaves records).

### Frontend Implementation

Kindly note that this is the frontend of the admin and HR side, implemented using React.
The website allows the admin to:
- store, edit and delete the users, vehicles and inspection information
- view attendance and leaves records
- approve/reject attendance records

As for the HR they can:
- view attendance and leaves records
- approve/reject attendance records

## Future Work

Now that the foundation of the project is setup, I'll be working on additional features like
- routing and route optimization,
- transforming the digital approvals into printable documents with signatures,
- more on data analytics
